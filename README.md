This project's intent is to demonstrate the use of Apache NiFi (and NiFi MiNiFi) to collect and make available application and device information.

The containers are pre-configured to run:
1. Hashicorp's Consul for application and host registration, discovery, and basic health monitoring
2. A basic Python HTTP server
3. nmon for generating snapshots of host performance and configuration data
4. Apache NiFi to gather metadata from Consul, logs from HTTP server, nmon, 'netstat', and 'ps' output

Run containers and start generating data:
```
docker-compose up
```

Data generated by the containers is saved in the 'data' directory of this project.

Also provided are Apache Zeppelin notebooks for parsing and analyzing the data collected by NiFi:

In a Zeppelin instance, import the two notebooks in 'zeppelin-notebooks'. Since Apache Spark doesn't support relative paths, edit the 'fs' value in DeviceRegistry-Setup's first paragraph and point it to the data directory in this project's root.

For example, on my MacBook, the project lives under /Users/randy/demos/techops, thus:
```
val fs = "/Users/randy/demos/techops/data"
```

Use Zeppelin's "Run All" feature to run all notes in DeviceRegistry-Setup before you can generate the charts in the DeviceRegistry notebook.

Sample data are provided for convenience in data.tgz. If you don't want to run containers yourself, simply tar -xzvf data.tgz, and the notebooks should be able to consume it.
